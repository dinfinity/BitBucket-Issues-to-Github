# Bitbucket Issues to Github Migration
A php commandline project created to migrate Bitbucket issues to Github.

This code is not actively maintained by me, may or may not be updated, nor has a reasonable attempt been made to make it user-friendly or pretty. It did work much better for me than similar projects available at that time. You may find it useful.

This project contains code from other open source projects, for which their licensing applies.
